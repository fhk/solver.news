# Solver.News

<ins>Q1 2022</ins>

A Quarterly update on the Mathematical Optimization Solver Industry and Ecosystem.

Exploring the creation, usage and adoption of solvers, soft/middle-ware, bespoke or industry specifc solutions.

So this is purely an idea at the moment. If 10 (ten) people sign up I will write the next one and make some improvements to the content :) Or perhaps people will just make PRs and this can continue to live... Or perhaps this is better on some kind of mailing list?

## All paths lead to ~~Rome~~ **Solvers**

keywords: launch, v0, PoC, optimization, solvers

Here is a first pass at creating some content around the industry and perhaps some valuable discussion. I toyed with the idea of calling the page "not just solvers" after the well known [not just bikes youtube channel](link).

The structure and direction of this is very much in flux and current represents my personal view. But should there be interest in a specific area please feel free to [email me](mailto:f.kauker@gmail.com).
### Creating a Industry index

The creation of a index. Why do we need a index? The larger field of "data science" is murky at best.

We'd like to know how the adoption of "mathematical optimization solvers" is going in industry. The overlap between academic and commerical usecases aswell as how the open source software is evolving.

### Conversations

Most recently I've had numerous conversations along the following lines:

1. I just learned about "optimization" how can I get started?
2. I want to build a model to prove a usecase for my business whats the "best" solver to use?
3. How should my business determine which commercial solver to utilize?
4. Do we even need a solver?

Before we takle these topics lets figure out if it even matters!

Here @Peter Cacioppi delivers what is in recent times to most expressive answer!

## Project Example

I'm going to cheat this time and share a WASM post I wrote and presented some time ago. Why? I really think that client side solving will become something!

Next up I might share a complete c++ example using or-tools.
